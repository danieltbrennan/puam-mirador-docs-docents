# The Mirador Image Viewer

## Introduction

Mirador has been in use at the Princeton University Art Museum since 2017 when it was first used to provide in-gallery deep zoom and page-turning experiences for the exhibition _Clarence H. White and His World_. Since then Mirador usage has expanded significantly and it is now the default deep-zoom image viewer within the Museum's online collection and through added customization it supports a variety of teaching, annotating, research, and storytelling functions.

As an open-source software project, Mirador is under continual development and new releases are made available on a regular basis. At the time of this documentation, the Art Museum currently supports Mirador version 3.0.0.
