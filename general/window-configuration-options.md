When viewing an object in Mirador the default view is the single-image view. In cases where multiple images are available, particularly for objects such as portfolios or scrolls, the user is provided with the option the switch to a gallery view that presents thumbnails of every available image for easy reference and navigation. This is accomplished using the view control button in the top right corner of the title bar.

In addition to viewing thumbnails for all available images in the gallery view, Mirador also provides the option to dock a bar of thumbnails to the buttom or the right side of the image viewing window, so as to be able to simultaneously navigate the image set while still keeping a selected image in focus. This feature is enabled using the view control button in top right corner of the title bar.

## Full-Screen Mode

Mirador will by default constrain itself to the size of your browser window, it is possible however to enter a full-screen mode that will expand to occupy the entirety of your screen. To enable this mode, click the full-screen button on the left side of the controls bar. To leave full-screen mode, use the escape key. _Note: full-screen mode will obscure any other windows open on your screen._

## Changing the Default Theme

Within Mirador it is possible to switch between several pre-defined color schemes. The Princeton University Art Museum supports a neutral "Princeton" theme, as well as Light and Dark themes. In order to switch between themes, use the "gear" icon to access the configuration menu from the left side of the screen.
