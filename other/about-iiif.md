# About IIIF

[Mirador](https://projectmirador.org) is an image viewer integrated with the [International Image Interoperability Framework \[IIIF\]](https://iiif.io). IIIF encompasses a set of protocols supported by a growing community of the worldâ€™s leading research libraries and image repositories in order to collaboratively produce an interoperable technology and community framework for image delivery, with the following goals:

* To give scholars an unprecedented level of uniform and rich access to image-based resources hosted around the world.
* To define a set of common application programming interfaces that support interoperability between image repositories.
* To develop, cultivate and document shared technologies, such as image servers and web clients, that provide a world-class user experience in viewing, comparing, manipulating and annotating images.
