# Working Across Collections

One of the core tenets of IIIF is enabling interoperability between image repositories. As such, use of Mirador is not limited to images from the Princeton University Art Museum but can be extended to work with images from any number of institutions that support IIIF. These [include](https://iiif.io/community/#participating-institutions) the Princeton University Library, the Smithsonian, and Yale University to name a few.

While methods of importing images into Mirador vary somewhat across institutions, generally speaking if an institution's online collection pages display the [IIIF icon](https://blogs.getty.edu/iris/30000-getty-museum-images-published-iiif/), it can be dragged into a Mirador window to display the image.
