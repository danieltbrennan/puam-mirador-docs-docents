# Comparing Multiple Objects

The List View configuration of Mirador allows for the side-by-side comparison of two or more objects within a single viewer window. In order to view objects in this manner, the user must add them one-by-one to the viewer window using the standard process for adding a single object. First, select the Start Here button to reach the object selection screen. Select the first object to add it to the viewing window.

Next, select the Add Resource button in the top left \(which will have replaced the Start Here button\) in order to go back to the object list. At this point, the user can select a second object to add to the viewing window. By default the window will split on a vertical axis, with each object occupying 50% of the available space. This process can be repeated for as many objects as desired, with each added object taking up 50% of the space of the one added previously.

When working with multiple objects in Mirador, each object in the viewing window can be considered as a miniature version of the default viewing window, with independent controls for zooming, panning, and cycling through multiple views \[see also: [Working with Images](../general/working-with-images.md)\]. Objects can be closed in any order by clicking the X icon in the upper right corner.
