# Overview

The List View configuration of the Mirador Viewer offers the ability to display and interact with multiple objects in the viewer while also retaining all views for objects that have multiple images. Additionally, this is the only viewer type in which the user is given the ability to compare two or more objects side-by-side within a single viewer window.
